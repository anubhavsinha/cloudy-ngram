cloudy-ngram
============

cloudy-ngram: is a REST web service which provides you the IDF of Unigrams, Bigrams..Ngrams upro N = 5.   
The service will be helpful for applications in the NLP domain, for eg. text-summarization, computational advertising etc.  
As of now, to get the IDF value taking all of the web as your corpus, your only bet is the Google N-gram corpus  
which is a 25Gb corpus and needs heavy distributed processing (MapReduce etc) to get the IDF.  

Cloudy-ngram makes it easy for everyone to have a free, fast IDF lookup on the cloud.
